# Steps

1. First, I created three objects in an array and there are arrays for the ingredients and steps as object of the array.

   1.1. I used for loop to show each card into the DOM:
    * Generated an html
        * created an html through the array object.
        * inserted the string html to the DOM: **beforeend** of the container.
        * added eventListener to the GENERATE button to show all the cards.

    1.2. I grabed the *more info* button to created a new modal for the detail.
    * created an inner-modal html so when the more info button is click, the modal will appears.
    * created a form input in script.js to create a new recipes after submit it.

 2. I did not catch requirements because:
     * I could make the the list of the ingredients and steps.

3. If i had more time, I would tried to understand why my loop for the list does not work and look for solution.
